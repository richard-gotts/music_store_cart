# Music Store Shopping Cart

This application is an shopping cart for customers at the fictional music supplies shop, imaginatively named 'The Music Store'.

The program allows customers to:

- View a list of available products
- Add or remove items from their cart
- View the total cost of their cart
- Checkout (terminates the application)

The code makes use of a range of functions to carry out specific tasks, and a single while loop which controls the flow of the program.
